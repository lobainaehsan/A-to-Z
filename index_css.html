		<p style="margin-left: 300px; margin-right: 300px">An ocean is a body of water that composes much of a planet's hydrosphere.[1] On Earth, an ocean is one of the major conventional divisions of the World Ocean. These are, in descending order by area, the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Southern (Antarctic), and Arctic Oceans.[2][3] The phrases "the ocean" or "the sea" used without specification refer to the interconnected body of salt water covering the majority of the Earth's surface.[2][3] As a general term, "the ocean" is mostly interchangeable with "the sea" in American English, but not in British English.[4] Strictly speaking, a sea is a body of water (generally a division of the world ocean) partly or fully enclosed by land.[5]</p><br>
